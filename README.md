# Connect-4 Artificial Intelligence Game

Connect-4 is a classic two-player connection game played on a seven-column, six-row grid. Players take turns dropping discs into the columns, aiming to be the first to form a line of four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game has been mathematically solved, meaning the first player can always win with the correct strategy.

This project explores the implementation of Connect-4 with artificial intelligence (AI), using the **Minimax algorithm** with enhancements such as
1. **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** To reduce the number of nodes evaluated. 
2. **Move Ordering:** To explore the most promising moves first.
3. **Transposition Tables:** To store previously evaluated positions.

to create an optimal game-playing AI. Additionally, the project incorporates a mechanism to calculate player performance, which can potentially be used for efficient task classification and job assignment in software-related fields.
